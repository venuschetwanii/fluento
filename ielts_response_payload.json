By 2020, middle-income became the largest group at 40%, high-income increased to 30%, low-income decreased to 25%, and very high-income remained at 5%. This shows economic growth and improved living standards over the 30-year period.",

      "response": "Technology has both positive and negative effects on our lives. Some people think it makes life more complicated because we have to learn new things all the time and there are many problems with computers and phones. Other people think technology makes life easier because we can do things faster and communicate with people far away. I think technology is mostly good because it helps us work better and stay connected with family and friends. However, we need to be careful not to use technology too much and remember to spend time with people in real life.",

It was a memorable trip because it was my first time in France and I learned about French culture. The people were friendly and the city was beautiful.",

However, this has caused some problems like overcrowding and pollution. The government is trying to manage tourism better by limiting visitors to some places and promoting sustainable tourism. I think tourism is good for the economy but we need to protect the environment and local culture.",
