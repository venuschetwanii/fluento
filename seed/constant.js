Part of the lot was occupied by St. Peter\'s Evangelical Church, and the congregation had no intention of relocating.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> Architect Hugh Stubbins came up with a novel design that would satisfy everyone involved. The new building would have a square foundation and rest on four nine-story tall towers located, not at the corners of the square, but at the centre of each side of the square. This had never been attempted on such a scale, but it would allow the church to continue to exist under a corner of the tower.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2461The church members agreed to the plan as long as Citicorp replaced their old, crumbling church with a new structure that was not directly connected to the tower.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">&nbsp;</mark></span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2462The company agreed and contracted structural engineering firm LeMessurier Associates to make their unique building a reality.</mark></span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>2</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2463Normally, the massive weight of a skyscraper is supported at its corners, but William LeMessurier devised an ingenious system of diagonal bracing girders that would transfer the building\'s weight from the corners to the side columns.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">&nbsp;</mark></span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2464The completed tower would be remarkably light, even at 279 metres tall, which meant that it would sway much more than usual in the wind.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> To compensate for this effect, LeMessurier decided to install a tuned-mass damper at the top of the structure. This was a 372 tonne concrete block that floated on pressurised oil bearings and was operated by electronic systems. With this damper in place, LeMessurier\'s calculations and wind tunnel tests indicated that the building would be structurally sound in strong perpendicular winds; winds that strike only one side of a building. However, there was an unexpected flaw in his design that would be compounded by decisions made during construction.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>3</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2465The problem was first noticed by Princeton University engineering student Diane Hartley when she was writing her undergraduate thesis about the Citicorp Center</mark>.</span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> She spoke with Joel S. Weinstein, a junior engineer with LeMessurier, who provided her with architectural plans and engineering calculations for the structure. According to her calculations, the stress caused by quartering winds (winds that hit a corner of the building and so affect two sides at the same time) would be significantly stronger than perpendicular winds. Due to its innovative design, she assumed that the firm must have done similar calculations.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#f4cccc;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">\u2465She asked Weinstein for his calculations on the effects of quartering winds, but he never sent them.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> When she expressed her concerns,&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#f4cccc;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">\u2465Weinstein assured her that the building design was safe and was actually more efficient than conventional designs. As she was still a student, Hartley deferred to his judgement, but she noted their conversation in her thesis nonetheless.</mark></span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"></span></p><p><span style="background-color:#f4cccc;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">\u2466In May of 1978, Stubbins and LeMessurier attended a meeting about skyscrapers that they had designed in Pittsburgh that incorporated the same bracing system. \u2466U.S. Steel thought that welded joints might make the project too expensive, so its representative asked if they could substitute bolts</mark>.</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"> <mark class="highlight-green">LeMessurier called his firm\'s New York City office to reassure him that the welded joints were the right way to go, but was informed that the same substitution had been made there without consulting him.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green"> </mark>Although surprised, he was not alarmed.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#f4cccc;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">\u2466He thought the decision was technically sound, and he couldn\'t expect them to contact him about every on-site decision.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">&nbsp;</mark></span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"></span></p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">In June, freshman engineering student Lee DeCarolis was writing his own paper about Citicorp Center and its seemingly unstable design. He spoke to LeMessurier, who assured him that the building was quite stable, and that its unique geometry and his diagonal-brace system made it particularly resistant to quartering winds.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2467However, since the New York building code did not require those calculations, he had not done them initially</mark>.</span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">&nbsp;</mark></span><span style="background-color:#f4cccc;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">\u2467Thinking that it would make an interesting topic for his students at Harvard, LeMessurier did the calculations</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">, and discovered that quartering winds would increase the stress in certain parts of the building by 40%. That was well within the limitations of his original design, but the original design had specified welded joints, not the bolts that had been used instead.

This technology works by inserting metal probes into the ground and sending electrical pulses through it. Soil, stone, air and water all resist electricity to different degrees, with water being very conductive and empty air being highly resistant, meaning electricity passes through the former easily and the latter hardly at all. The signals that the probes received allowed scientists to create a three-dimensional image of what lies concealed beneath the ground.&nbsp;</span><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Underneath the pyramid,&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;">Ⓔthey discovered an irregular empty space that was partially filled with water and was 25 metres by 35 metres and up to 20 metres deep.

Part of the lot was occupied by St. Peter\'s Evangelical Church, and the congregation had no intention of relocating.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> Architect Hugh Stubbins came up with a novel design that would satisfy everyone involved. The new building would have a square foundation and rest on four nine-story tall towers located, not at the corners of the square, but at the centre of each side of the square. This had never been attempted on such a scale, but it would allow the church to continue to exist under a corner of the tower.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2461The church members agreed to the plan as long as Citicorp replaced their old, crumbling church with a new structure that was not directly connected to the tower.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">&nbsp;</mark></span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2462The company agreed and contracted structural engineering firm LeMessurier Associates to make their unique building a reality.</mark></span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>2</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2463Normally, the massive weight of a skyscraper is supported at its corners, but William LeMessurier devised an ingenious system of diagonal bracing girders that would transfer the building\'s weight from the corners to the side columns.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">&nbsp;</mark></span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2464The completed tower would be remarkably light, even at 279 metres tall, which meant that it would sway much more than usual in the wind.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> To compensate for this effect, LeMessurier decided to install a tuned-mass damper at the top of the structure. This was a 372 tonne concrete block that floated on pressurised oil bearings and was operated by electronic systems. With this damper in place, LeMessurier\'s calculations and wind tunnel tests indicated that the building would be structurally sound in strong perpendicular winds; winds that strike only one side of a building. However, there was an unexpected flaw in his design that would be compounded by decisions made during construction.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>3</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2465The problem was first noticed by Princeton University engineering student Diane Hartley when she was writing her undergraduate thesis about the Citicorp Center</mark>.</span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> She spoke with Joel S. Weinstein, a junior engineer with LeMessurier, who provided her with architectural plans and engineering calculations for the structure. According to her calculations, the stress caused by quartering winds (winds that hit a corner of the building and so affect two sides at the same time) would be significantly stronger than perpendicular winds. Due to its innovative design, she assumed that the firm must have done similar calculations.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#f4cccc;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">\u2465She asked Weinstein for his calculations on the effects of quartering winds, but he never sent them.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> When she expressed her concerns,&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#f4cccc;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">\u2465Weinstein assured her that the building design was safe and was actually more efficient than conventional designs.

That was well within the limitations of his original design, but the original design had specified welded joints, not the bolts that had been used instead.

The frequency and severity of natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts have increased significantly. Scientists agree that human activities, such as burning fusion fuels and deforestation, are major contributors to climate change. It is imperative that we take immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas diffusions and transition to renewable energy sources. We must mitigate the impacts of climate change on our planet if for no other reason than that it is the only place we know of that can support our species.",

He spoke to LeMessurier, who assured him that the building was quite stable, and that its unique geometry and his diagonal-brace system made it particularly resistant to quartering winds.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2467However, since the New York building code did not require those calculations, he had not done them initially</mark>.</span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">&nbsp;</mark></span><span style="background-color:#f4cccc;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">\u2467Thinking that it would make an interesting topic for his students at Harvard, LeMessurier did the calculations</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">, and discovered that quartering winds would increase the stress in certain parts of the building by 40%. That was well within the limitations of his original design, but the original design had specified welded joints, not the bolts that had been used instead. He redid the calculations taking bolts into account, and 40% increased to 160%.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>6</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Then, he went to New York and learned that his team had defined the braces as trusses instead of columns. Therefore, they thought they were exempt from a safety standard, and had used fewer bolts.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2468After running more wind tunnel tests, he determined that the weakest joint was located on the 30th floor, and its failure would cause a catastrophic collapse of the entire building.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">&nbsp;</mark></span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2469After examining historical weather records, he found that a storm capable of causing that failure occurred on average about once every 16 years, also known as a 16-year storm.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green"> </mark>That frequency was frighteningly high, and after consulting other experts and colleagues, he confronted his firm\'s insurance company with the grim news.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>7</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u246aLeMessurier and Stubbins met with Citicorp\'s management and outlined the problem and a possible solution.

Then on September 1st, Hurricane Ella was reported to be on a collision course with the city. Fortunately, the storm veered off eastward, and repairs were completed in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>8</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">The aftermath of the crisis was noteworthy because it produced no villains.

The public was not informed about what had transpired until a thorough article was published in&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i> in 1995. Since then, the crisis has become a case study used in architectural ethics classes.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>',

He spoke to LeMessurier, who assured him that the building was quite stable, and that its unique geometry and his diagonal-brace system made it particularly resistant to quartering winds.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2467However, since the New York building code did not require those calculations, he had not done them initially</mark>.</span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">&nbsp;</mark></span><span style="background-color:#f4cccc;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-red">\u2467Thinking that it would make an interesting topic for his students at Harvard, LeMessurier did the calculations</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">, and discovered that quartering winds would increase the stress in certain parts of the building by 40%. That was well within the limitations of his original design, but the original design had specified welded joints, not the bolts that had been used instead. He redid the calculations taking bolts into account, and 40% increased to 160%.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>6</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Then, he went to New York and learned that his team had defined the braces as trusses instead of columns. Therefore, they thought they were exempt from a safety standard, and had used fewer bolts.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2468After running more wind tunnel tests, he determined that the weakest joint was located on the 30th floor, and its failure would cause a catastrophic collapse of the entire building.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">&nbsp;</mark></span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2469After examining historical weather records, he found that a storm capable of causing that failure occurred on average about once every 16 years, also known as a 16-year storm.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green"> </mark>That frequency was frighteningly high, and after consulting other experts and colleagues, he confronted his firm\'s insurance company with the grim news.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>7</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u246aLeMessurier and Stubbins met with Citicorp\'s management and outlined the problem and a possible solution. They could weld five-centimetre-thick steel plates over weak joints like bandages.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green"> </mark>The company explained the situation to<mark class="highlight-green">&nbsp;</mark></span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u246bthe city\'s Building Commission, which gave a carefully written press release stating that the structural work was \'only a prudent response to new meteorological data.</mark>\'</span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> Repairs began almost immediately and progressed rapidly. Then on September 1st, Hurricane Ella was reported to be on a collision course with the city. Fortunately, the storm veered off eastward, and repairs were completed in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>8</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">The aftermath of the crisis was noteworthy because it produced no villains. Everyone was honest and forthcoming, the people involved in the repairs cooperated to achieve a common goal and there was no finger-pointing or accusations of blame.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u246cThe exact cost of the repairs remains undisclosed, but LeMessurier Associates and its insurers reimbursed Citicorp for an agreed two million dollars, and the courts were never involved.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> LeMessurier had expected to be ruined by the crisis, but due to his actions, his reputation was actually enhanced. The public was not informed about what had transpired until a thorough article was published in&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i> in 1995. Since then, the crisis has become a case study used in architectural ethics classes.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>',

The reasons for this are quite simple: the land is relatively flat and easy to build on, the sea provides food through fishing and it provides easy transportation. However, building our settlements near the ocean also comes with inherent risks.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> When certain conditions are met, mountainous waves can rush inland and wash away people, homes and even entire cities. Where this kind of natural disaster is particularly common or dangerous, people have sometimes provided warnings to future generations by carving messages onto stones. In Japan, carved stones called \'tsunami stones\' dot hillsides along the archipelago\'s coast, but people do not always heed their warnings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>2/B</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">The islands of Japan lie at the convergent boundary between several tectonic plates, which make them prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. When geological events such as these disturb the sea floor, they can generate massive waves called tsunamis that inundate the land.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u246eFirst, the water rapidly recedes from the beach as though the tide is going out very quickly, then the water returns with the full force of the ocean behind it. That is why tsunamis are sometimes referred to by the misleading term \'tidal waves.\'</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> Tsunami waves can be tens of metres high, which allows them to roll deep inland and endanger settlements far from the coast. They also tend to come in a series of waves that first flood the land and then retreat, dragging debris with them into the ocean only to bring it back on the next wave. This repeated action makes them extremely devastating and can strip away everything down to the bedrock.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>3/C</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Japan has suffered through some of the most destructive and deadly tsunamis in history.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u246fWhen people survive these catastrophic events, they understandably want to prevent their descendants from enduring similar experiences, but people have short memories. According to Fumiko Imamura, a professor of disaster planning at Tohoku University, \'It takes about three generations for people to forget.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> Those that experience the disaster themselves pass it to their children and their grandchildren, but then the memory fades.\' That is why some ancestors of modern Japanese people decided to carve tsunami stones. Hundreds of tsunami stones have been found around Japan, but the majority of them are concentrated in the northeastern coastal areas.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>4</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u2470The oldest existing stones were erected over 600 years ago, and some were later washed away by more powerful events. That, in itself, is a message as the stones range from one to three metres tall, and can weigh several tonnes</mark>.</span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> Each stone has an inscription, but some have been worn away over the centuries. Some of them function as monuments that provide death tolls and may even mark the victims\' mass graves. Others advise people to seek higher ground after an earthquake, and a few have place names that carry clear messages. Namiwake means \'Wave\'s Edge\' and it is located three miles from the coast marking the farthest reach of the 1611 tsunami. Nokoriya translates as \'Valley of Survivors\' and it marks a location that has clearly provided a safe haven from the waves.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>5/D</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u3253One famous tsunami stone near the small village of Aneyoshi provides unusually clear instructions.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> The 1.5 metre slab of stone says, \'High dwellings are the peace and harmony of our descendants. Remember the calamity of the great tsunamis. Do not build any homes below this point.\'&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u3254This is the only stone that specifically tells people where to build their homes.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> Aneyoshi was struck by two tsunamis that nearly wiped out the village completely. The first was during the 1896 Sanriku earthquake, which killed at least 22,000 people across Japan and all but two of the villagers. The village was repopulated, and had moved back down toward the shore a few years later. Then, in 1933, another earthquake birthed a tsunami that only left four villagers alive.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;">\u3255They moved farther uphill, and carved the stone to protect the following generations.</span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> Indeed, Aneyoshi survived tsunamis in 1960 and 2011 unscathed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>6/E</strong></span></p><p><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u3256After World War II, coastal towns and cities rapidly grew as people disregarded the warnings of the tsunami stones.</mark></span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> For many people, the tsunami stones seemed like relics of the distant past written in archaic language that is difficult to read, so they were ignored. Residents put their faith in advanced technology to detect seismic events and warn them of approaching waves, and they built taller seawalls to protect them.<mark class="highlight-green">&nbsp;</mark></span><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;color:#000000;"><mark class="highlight-green">\u3257Unfortunately, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami were among the worst in Japanese history, and the waves easily swept over and shattered the sea walls</mark>.</span><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"> This disaster left 15,894 people dead, 6,156 injured and 2,546 missing. Some experts think that Japan needs a new version of the tsunami stones that is easier to understand. One suggestion is to preserve some of the ruined buildings from 2011 to provide permanent reminders of the destructive force of the waves.&nbsp;</span></p>',
